                                        Global warming is becoming worse in the past few years, Philippines is the third biggest contributor to ocean pollution-worldwide. Some areas in the Philippines mainly focus on blooming business or industry, the environmental issues have been put aside
                                        and it is becoming worse than ever. This motivates the researchers to conduct crowdsourcing on environmental issues and how long the environmental issue has not been solved. Once the crowdsourcing is done, the researchers
                                        will talk to LGU that these issues need to be solved right away.
